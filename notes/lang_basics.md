# Basics

## java file structure
- public class name == file name
    - You can have 0 or 1 public class per .java file.
    - This is required because java is designed to be stricty organized and makes it easier for tools/compilers to find things.
    - Their are 4 access levels to java.
        | access level  | Visible inside same package? | Visible outside package? |
        | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
        | public     |      |     |
        | no modifier (package-private)      |     |     |
        | protected      |     |     | 
        | private      |     |     |
